CHANGES FROM 3.0.2 to 3.0.3
---------------------------

   (from <https://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-3.0.3>, 2022-08-05)

3.0.3 is a bugfix release.

There's a vulnerability fixed in modpack installer. All users
of older versions are adviced to upgrade.

Default metaserver connection URL and URL used to fetch default modpack list
have been updated to use https -protocol. This should cause no problems if
https has been working for you all the time. However, if it was already broken
(e.g. you couldn't download modpacks located on https even with earlier freeciv
version), this makes the problem worse for you. The most likely cause for any
problems with https is that root certificates (cacerts) are not set up properly.
From freeciv side, building with the configuration option --with-cacert-path
may help. In case everything else fails, we provide, for now, a .project file
that you can use to build freeciv so that metaserver and modpack list
default URLs still use http:
--with-project-definition=<freeciv srcdir>/bootstrap/http.project
We won't support that on freeciv-3.1.

3.0.0-beta3 fixes some issues still seen with beta2, and is expected
to be the last beta release before stable 3.0.0 release.

Server / General
Changes affecting players (supplied rulesets)

    * Ransom is given for each barbarian leader when there's more
      than one in the same tile (but no other units to defend them).
      The old behavior was not to give ransom at all as they were
      considered to be defending each other. osdn#42020
    * Fixed server setting tradeworldrelpct to affect also
      the initial one time bonus of the trade route. osdn#42097
    * Server correctly informs client when loading a savegame fails.
      It used to always claim that load was succesfull to the client
      osdn#42189
    * Game refuses paradropping to a tile with known enemy unit
      as that would only be certain death for the paradropping unit

    * Fixed a bug that when player providing shared vision was removed,
      the vision would remain for the other players HRM#883225

      Especially this makes bribe cost of units with build cost
      less than ten not to be zero. HRM#929034
    * Avoid server getting stuck when loading ruleset that has
      unit obsoletion loop osdn#42301

      turned on osdn#42499

      is larger than 65534 HRM#927510

    * civ2civ3 & sandbox
         + Ships with zero attack power no longer cause unhappiness,
           fighters with fuel over one turn do osdn#42078
         + civ2civ3 only Welcome message points directs user to find
           more information from About Current Ruleset osdn#42329
         + Reworked the way labels get assigned to the map
           when it's generated osdn#42708

    * civ1
         + Made traderoute one-time-bonus gold only osdn#42317
         + Savepalace server setting is disabled by default osdn#42266

    * civ2
         + Savepalace server setting is disabled by default osdn#42266

         + Clean format by always setting irrigation_time / plant_time
           to zero when the activity in question is disabled by
           relevant _result field. This does not change how
           the ruleset behaves, but is less confusing to read osdn#42211

    * italy scenario
         + Wrap map from the correct point so that leftmost part
           of the map is connected to the rest HRM#691812

    * british isles scenario
         + Scenario now uses nationset all, so the correct nations
           from the isles are available and get placed,
           instead of completely random nations from the core nationset
           osdn#42939

Changes affecting other rulesets / modders

    * Terrain transform time of zero now really disables transforming,
