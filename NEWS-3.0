CHANGES FROM 3.0.0 to 3.0.1
---------------------------

   (from <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-3.0.1>, 2022-04-11)

3.0.1 is a generic bugfix release.

Server / General

    * Fixed "turn_begin" lua signal, affecting especially 32bit Windows
      builds. This, e.g., makes various welcome messages to show up osdn#41662
    * Fixed some problems in builds where asserts are not enabled.
      More work remains. osdn#43871 osdn#44129 osdn#44019 osdn#44020
    * Fixed error messages sometimes appearing when a city has been removed
      but units remain (e.g. in case of Sentried Helicopter) osdn#44057
    * Correctly convert it, when savegame with AI level "Experimental"
      is loaded to a non-debug build osdn#44165

      no longer stored to savegames at all. Current freeciv version can't

Server / General
Changes affecting players (supplied rulesets)

    * Ransom is given for each barbarian leader when there's more
      than one in the same tile (but no other units to defend them).

      the initial one time bonus of the trade route. osdn#42097

      unit obsoletion loop osdn#42301

         + civ2civ3 only Welcome message points directs user to find
           more information from About Current Ruleset osdn#42329
         + Reworked the way labels get assigned to the map
           when it's generated osdn#42708

         + Clean format by always setting irrigation_time / plant_time
           to zero when the activity in question is disabled by
           relevant _result field. This does not change how
           the ruleset behaves, but is less confusing to read osdn#42211

    * italy scenario
         + Wrap map from the correct point so that leftmost part
           of the map is connected to the rest HRM#691812

    * british isles scenario
         + Scenario now uses nationset all, so the correct nations
           from the isles are available and get placed,
           instead of completely random nations from the core nationset
           osdn#42939

Changes affecting other rulesets / modders

    * Terrain transform time of zero now really disables transforming,

      just postponed osdn#41925
